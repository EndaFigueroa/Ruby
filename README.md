We were tasked to research Ruby and then complete a presentation for the class. In order to demonstrate Ruby and its OOP pillars, I made a simple slideshow program in Ruby.
Completed over a weekend.

There is also an example ruby as well, meant to run in the terminal as well, so that the commented code can be seen as well as the abstraction in the terminal.
